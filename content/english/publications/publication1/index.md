summary = "In this paper, we present CroSloMet, a novel dataset of over 1,120 metaphorical and 1,120 literal sentences in Croatian and Slovene, grounded in the MetaNet.HR framework. Each example is annotated with the corresponding conceptual metaphor, linguistic multi-word expression (MWE), canonical forms, and literal usage, enabling both metaphor identification and explanation tasks."
