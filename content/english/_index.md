### Laboratory for Machine Learning and Language Technologies

MLLT research areas are artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, natural language processing, image analysis, cognitive modelling, and data mining. Research is applied to cognitive, medical, biological, financial, and other processes. We are developing, testing, and applying new approaches and algorithms for modelling from numeric, symbolic and pictorial data. Recent research is related to deep neural networks in language and graphs, neuro-symbolic processing, data generation, reliability of models’ predictions in classification and regression, reliability of clustering, ensemble learning, latent models for count data, cross-lingual model transfer, text summarization, modelling sports data, user profiling, recommendation systems, mining spatial data, and mining of data streams.
