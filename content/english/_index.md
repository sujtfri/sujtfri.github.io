## Laboratory for Machine Learning and Language Technologies (SUJT)

**We are a scientific laboratory specializing in research and development in the fields of machine learning and language technologies.**

Our work focuses on understanding and processing language in various contexts, such as healthcare, digital humanities, and pharmaceuticals.

We conduct research in the areas of data mining, neural networks, artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and large-scale data stream analysis.

- We develop and apply new approaches and algorithms for data modeling.
- Our research has practical value. We collaborate with doctors, pharmacists, biologists, sports experts, and linguists.
- Our research subfields include modeling numerical, symbolic, image, textual, and spatial data, medical diagnostics and prognostics, generating partially synthetic data, and language technologies.
