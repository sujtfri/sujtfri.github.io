# Centre of Excellence in AI for Digital Humanities (AI4DH)

The ERA Chair project “Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence in Digital Humanities” (AI4DH) is an ambitious initiative aimed at improving the capacity for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into research conducted at the University of Ljubljana (UL) in the field of digital humanities (DH). The project aims to establish UL as a leading institution in Europe for the use of AI in DH by establishing a Centre of Excellence that combines cutting-edge AI research with collaboration and support for scholars in DH fields. The CO will support research excellence and provide training and services to increase the capacity of DH disciplines to exploit the many opportunities offered by AI. The CoE aims to attract projects for its sustainable operation, improve the university’s research infrastructure and reverse the brain drain from the region by attracting researchers to Slovenia. The AI4DH Centre is established under the leadership of Professor Antoine Doucet, who is also Professor of Computer Science at the University of La Rochelle in France.
