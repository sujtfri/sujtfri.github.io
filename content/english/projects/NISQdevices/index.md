# Practical quantum advantage of reservoir computing on NISQ devices

Learning variational quantum circuits is challenging. One possible solution to the vanishing gradient problem is quantum reservoir computing, which does not require much learning or fine control of quantum devices, making it promising for achieving practical quantum advantage. This project explores quantum reservoir computing on current quantum devices through experiments, theory, and simulations.

(i) Performing proof-of-concept experiments with muons and cold atoms.

(ii) Exploring the connections between reservoir computing and quantum computing.

(iii) Simulating different models of quantum reservoir computing to assess their utility.

By combining these approaches, we aim to assess the potential of quantum reservoir computing for achieving practical quantum advantage.
