# LLM4DH - Large language models for digital humanities

The LLM4DH proposal aims to increase Slovene research capacity in the field of language technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital humanities (DH)1. This goal is an integral part of the UL Strategy 2022-20272 and Slovene National Programme for AI 20253. The project brings together top Slovene researchers and institutions in the area of language technologies and connects them with leading researchers and institutions in selected areas of digital humanities, thereby facilitating innovation and excellence and consolidating the international position of Slovenian research. The envisaged research focuses on significant contributions to research at the global level and has the potential to deliver scientific breakthroughs. The aim of the project is to complement the scientific impact with a broader societal impact, applying state-of-the-art in AI and LT to transform DH and to better understand language, history, humans, and society. The project will produce excellent scientific results and organize a series of dissemination and outreach activities, encouraging public participation and citizens’ science.

The project will improve the technology of large language models with different data and knowledge, reduce the computational complexity of speech technologies, and give them access to reliable external information. Improvements in the core capabilities of large language models will lead to breakthroughs in several areas of the digital humanities: linguistics and lexicography, education, analysis of social phenomena and contemporary history, folkloristics, and law.
