# SMASH – Machine Learning for Science and the Humanities

SMASH is an innovative, cross-sectoral training programme for career development, co-funded under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie COFUND (MSCA COFUND) calls for proposals for the period 2023-2028. The aim of the SMASH programme is to improve research excellence and career prospects of outstanding postdoctoral researchers from around the world. The best Slovenian institutions will host fifty talented postdoctoral researchers and enable them to develop their research ideas with access to the data science potential of the VEGA supercomputer, one of the newest high-performance computers in Europe. Additional priorities of the SMASH programme will be mobility opportunities and top-notch training in scientific and soft skills in cooperation with a group of associated programme partners in Slovenia, the EU and beyond.
