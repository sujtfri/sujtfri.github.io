**Title: Arithmetic circuits of Bayesian networks with noisy-or dependencies**
presentation by J. Vomlel and P. Savicky  
Bayesian networks (BN) are quite a general type of models for representing distributions on several variables, among which we have only a limited number of dependencies. We consider only BN on discrete variables. Such BN may be represented by a multilinear polynomial. If this polynomial may be evaluated using a small arithmetic circuit, it may be used as an alternative way of efficient inference in the distribution described by the BN. The talk will describe the polynomial, briefly discusses some of the known methods for constructing circuits for this polynomial and then we present an experimental comparison between two ways of preprocessing networks containing noisy-or dependencies (parent divorcing and tensor rank one decomposition) before constructing the circuit. Good properties of the latter are supported both theoretically and experimentaly.

**Title: Learning Forest of Trees from Data Streams**  
Abstract: This lecture presents a system for induction of forest of functional trees from data streams able to detect concept drift. The Ultra Fast Forest of Trees (UFFT) is an incremental algorithm, that works online, processing each example in constant time, and performing a single scan over the training examples. It uses analytical techniques to choose the splitting criteria, and the information gain to estimate the merit of each possible splitting-test. For multi-class problems the algorithm grows a binary tree for each possible pair of classes, leading to a forest of trees. Decision nodes and leaves contain naive-Bayes classifiers playing different roles during the induction process. Naive-Bayes in leaves are used to classify test examples, naive-Bayes in inner nodes can be used as multivariate splitting-tests if chosen by the splitting criteria, and used to detect drift in the distribution of the examples that traverse the node. The use of naive-Bayes classifiers at leaves to classify test examples, the use of splitting-tests based on the outcome of naive-Bayes, and the use of naive-Bayes classifiers at decision nodes to detect drift are directly obtained from the sufficient statistics required to compute the splitting criteria, without no additional computations. This aspect is a main advantage in the context of high-speed data streams. This methodology was tested with artificial and real-world data sets. The experimental results show a very good performance in comparison to a batch decision tree learner, and high capacity to detect and react to drift.

**Title: R-PREV: A Rule-based framework for the Prediction of Rare Extreme Values**
Abstract: In this presentation it will be described a rule learning method that obtains models biased towards a particular class of regression tasks. These tasks have as main distinguishing feature the fact that the main goal is to be accurate at predicting rare extreme values of the continuous target variable. Many real-world applications from scientific areas like ecology, meteorology, finance,etc., share this objective. Most existing approaches to regression problems search for the model parameters that optimize a given average error estimator (e.g. mean squared error). This means that they are biased towards achieving a good performance on the most common cases. The motivation for our work is the claim that being accurate at a small set of rare cases requires different error metrics. Moreover, given the nature and relevance of this type of applications an interpretable model is usually of key importance to domain experts, as predicting these rare events is normally associated with costly decisions. Our proposed system R-PREV obtains a set of interpretable regression rules derived from a set of bagged regression trees using evaluation metrics that bias the resulting models to predict accurately rare extreme values. We provide an experimental evaluation of our method confirming the advantages of our proposal in terms of accuracy in predicting rare extreme values.
